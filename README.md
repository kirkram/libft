# LIBFT

`libft` is a custom implementation of the C standard library functions. This project is part of the curriculum at Hive Helsinki and aims to deepen the understanding of C programming by re-implementing standard functions and creating additional utility functions.

## Installation
To compile the library, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```
make
```
## Usage
Include the `libft.h` header file in your C source files and link against the `libft.a` library when compiling your programs.
